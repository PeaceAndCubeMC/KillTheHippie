# Kill The Hippie
A plugin providing custom scenarios for the Kill The Hippie event.

Depends on [UhcCore](https://github.com/Mezy/UhcCore).

## Scenarios

### FoodStart
- You start the game with 10 cooked beef items.

### FullFlowers
- Your goal is to collect every flower of Minecraft.
- Once you have them all, you get 15 hearts until the end of the game, no matter how much health you have left.
- Wither skeletons have a 1 in 5 chance of giving wither roses.
- The /flowers command allows you to see your progress.

### NetheriteLess
- You can't get any netherite item.
